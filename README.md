# Sketch2Num

<p>Sketch2Num is a machine learning application that can classify handwritten digits . Users can draw to a digit on a dashboard and predict in real-time. The project is built using Python and Tensorflow </p>

<h2>Features </h2>
Character Dashboard: Users can draw any digit on the interface, and the app will predict the input using a trained model.
Real-time Predictions: The dashboard provides quick predictions for drawn characters and words using a pre-trained machine learning model.
